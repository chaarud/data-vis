<title>Global Military Spending</title>

<body>

  <h1>Background</h1>
  <p>
    Every year, well over a trillion dollars is spent collectively by the world's nations on their militaries. This narrative visualization is an
    attempt to provide an overview of some of the data available about military expenditures, and let the viewer see some of the 
    historical spending trends for various countries.
  </p>
  <p>
    The source of this data is the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's Military Expenditure Database. It is available <a href="https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex">here</a>.
    All spending is accounted for in US dollars, adjusted for inflation versus the 2018 dollar.

  <h1>Global Military Spending Over Time - Top 15 Nations</h1>
  
  <p>
    This first scene shows how the world's 15 largest military spenders have changed their spending over time. Over the last 25 years, we can see that the 
    general trend in military spending is upwards as time passes. Some countries, such as the US and China, have increased their military spending dramatically,
    while many others, like France and Germany, have kept spending fairly consistent.
