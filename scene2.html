  <h1>Comparing Military Spending with Population as of 2018</h1>
  
  <p>
    This scene shows how a country's population relates to its military spending. Unsurprisingly, we see that countries with large populations
    tend to have large military expenditures. However, there are a few interesting outliers - the US, for being so much higher than anyone 
    else on the chart, and India, for being relatively low-expenditure for a relatively high population. Other outliers that instantly 
    jump out as a result of this chart are Haiti's extremely low military spending, or the high per-capita military spending of Singapore, Kuwait, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The size of the data points in this scene corresponds to the country's military spending per capita, to more clearly indicate which countries spend 
    relatively large amounts of money on their militaries for each person that lives in them. Point sizes are calculated on a log scale, with a minimum size so as to not completely lose countries that spend relatively little per person.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Mousing over a data point indicates the country's name, along with its population and military spending in 2018.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because of the highly skewed nature of the distribution of population and military spending across the world's countries, both 
    axes of this plot are in a log scale.
