  <h1>Country-Specific Military Spending</h1>
  
  <p>
    The final scene is an interactive one - the user gets to choose which country they want to view military spending data for. All data is 
    given in 2018 US dollars. It's worth noting that while the oldest data stretches back to 1949, many countries have spotty data records 
    for some or all of the years between 1949 and now. For example, a country may have kept their military spending a secret, or may not have 
    existed independently for some or all of the years between 1949 and now. The USSR is an example of this - data on its expenditures is 
    sparse because it was secret prior to 1988, and the country did not exist after 1991.

    Hovering over a bar will provide a tooltip indicating the year and exact military expenditure value for that year.
