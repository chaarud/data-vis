  <h1>Comparing Defense Spending with Population as of 2018</h1>
  
  <p>
    This scene shows how a country's population relates to its military spending. Unsurprisingly, we see that countries with large populations
    tend to have large military expenditures. However, there are a few interesting outliers - the US, for being so much higher than anyone 
    else on the chart, and India, for being relatively low-expenditure for a relatively high population. Other outliers that instantly 
    jump out as a result of this chart are Haiti's extremely low military spending.

    Mousing over a data point indicates the country's name, along with its population and defense spending in 2018.
